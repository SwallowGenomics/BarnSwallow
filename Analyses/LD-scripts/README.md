## Scripts used for LD computation

This folder contains the perl scripts used for LD computation. <br />
[LDaverage.pl](https://github.com/SwallowGenomics/BarnSwallow/blob/main/Analyses/LD-scripts/LDaverage.pl) computes the average LD, calculated as r^2 by plink, between all marker pairs within a specified physical distance (this value must be given, in base pairs, as second input). The first input file is the output generated by plink when computing LD. Use the command `perl LDaverage.pl <example_inputfile.ld> <bin-size(bp)>` to run this script. <br />
[chr_ld.pl](https://github.com/SwallowGenomics/BarnSwallow/blob/main/Analyses/LD-scripts/chr_ld.pl) computes the average LD value over non-overlapping windows. A minimum number of markers per window can be specified (default 40). Use the command `perl chr_ld.pl <example_inputfile.ld> <window size(bp)> <minimum marker pairs>` to run this script. <br />
The file `example_inputfile.ld` is provided as an example of input file for these scripts.
