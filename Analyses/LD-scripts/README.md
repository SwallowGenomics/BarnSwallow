## Scripts used for LD computation

This folder contains the perl scripts used for LD computation. <br />

[LDaverage.pl](https://github.com/SwallowGenomics/BarnSwallow/blob/main/Analyses/LD-scripts/LDaverage.pl) computes the average LD, calculated as r<sup>2</sup> by plink, between all marker pairs within a specified physical distance.<br />
Required parameters are <em>input filename</em> (usully is the output generated by plink) and <em>window size</em>, which is the maximum distance between markers (in base pairs). Output is <em>window range, average r<sup>2</sup> and number of marker-pairs in the window</em>.<br />
Use the command `perl LDaverage.pl <example_inputfile.ld> <bin-size(bp)>` to run this script. <br />

[chr_ld.pl](https://github.com/SwallowGenomics/BarnSwallow/blob/main/Analyses/LD-scripts/chr_ld.pl) computes the average LD value over non-overlapping windows. A minimum number of markers per bin can be specified (default 40). 
Use the command `perl chr_ld.pl <example_inputfile.ld> <bin size(bp)> <minimum marker pairs>` to run this script. <br />
Output columns are: <em>chromosome_name, bin_start_pos, bin_end_pos, avg_r2, avg_D-value, #of_marker-pairs_in_bin</em>.

The file [example_inputfile.ld](https://github.com/SwallowGenomics/BarnSwallow/blob/main/Analyses/LD-scripts/example_inputfile.ld) is provided as an example of input file for those scripts.
