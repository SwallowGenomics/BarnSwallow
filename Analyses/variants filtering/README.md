## Variant calling files filtering procedure


The text file present in this folder contains the commands used to filter variants called from the *H. r. rustica* population (ds2.2) from [Schield et al., 2021](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mec.15885). <br />
Only the pipeline relative to this population is reported as an example, but the same type of commands was used to filter all vcf files. <br />
These filtering commands are based on [bcftools](https://samtools.github.io/bcftools/bcftools.html). [vcftools](https://vcftools.github.io/examples.html) is also used to compute some statistics.
