## Scripts used for generating the Cactus alignment and coverage calculation

This folder contains the perl scripts used for LD computation. <br />

[LDaverage.pl](LDaverage.pl) computes the average LD, calculated as r<sup>2</sup> by plink, between all marker pairs within a specified physical distance.<br />
Required parameters are <em>input filename</em> (usually is the output generated by plink) and <em>bin-size</em>, which is the maximum distance between markers (in base pairs). Output is <em>window range, average r<sup>2</sup> and number of marker-pairs in the bin</em>.<br />
Use the command `perl LDaverage.pl <example_inputfile.ld> <bin-size(bp)>` to run this script. <br />

[chr_ld.pl](chr_ld.pl) computes the average LD value over non-overlapping windows. A minimum number of markers per bin can be specified (default 40). 
Use the command `perl chr_ld.pl <example_inputfile.ld> <window-size(bp)> <minimum marker pairs>` to run this script. <br />
Output columns are: <em>chromosome_name, window_start_pos, window_end_pos, avg_r2, avg_D-value, #of_marker-pairs_in_window</em>.

The file [example_inputfile.ld](example_inputfile.ld) is provided as an example of input file for those scripts.
