## Pangenome variant calling

This folder contains the scripts and commands used to call variants on a region of the pangenome (CAMK2N2 gene).

The starting pangenome was produced with the script [Pangenome_assembly.txt](https://github.com/SwallowGenomics/BarnSwallow/blob/main/Analyses/Pangenome/Pangenome_assembly/Pangenome_assembly.txt) 

Pangenome pre-processing was done following the GitHub issue [#3411](https://github.com/vgteam/vg/issues/3411)

Variant calling was performed following the "Calling the graph by first splitting into components" section of of the tutorial [Whole genome calling and genotyping](https://github.com/vgteam/vg/wiki/Whole-genome-calling-and-genotyping)
