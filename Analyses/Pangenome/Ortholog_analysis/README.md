## Ortholog analysis on the pangenome

The analysis was performed using [halLiftover-postprocessing](https://github.com/pfenninglab/halLiftover-postprocessing)

Coverage and liftover of gene coordinates were performed with the [Hal Toolkit package](https://github.com/ComparativeGenomicsToolkit/hal).  <br />

Other tools used were: [wigToBigWig](https://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/linux.x86_64.v369/wigToBigWig) and [bigWigToBedGraph](https://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/linux.x86_64.v369/bigWigToBedGraph).
