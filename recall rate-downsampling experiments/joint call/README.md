# recall rate-downsampling experiments

The R file present in this folder contains the commands used to plot the number of variants identified after downsampling, comparing joint vs solo variant calling. <br />
Datasets are divided according to the type of variant identified: SVs (structural variants), indels (insertions-deletions), SNVs (single nucleotide variants)  <br />
"down" files contain variants number in the downsampled dataset (5x); "full" files contain variants number in the full coverage dataset.
