# BDNF gene structure plot

The R file present in this folder contains the commands used to generate the plot relative to the structure of the different barn swallow BDNF isoforms.  <br />
Tables contaning all computed values are provided. "Big exons" files contain coding exons coordinates. "Small exons" files contain non coding exons coordinates. "Whole" files contain full length sequences coordinates.  <br />
CpG_islands file contains CpG islands coordinates within BDNF gene.
