## *BDNF* gene structure plot

The R file present in this folder contains the commands used to generate the plot relative to the structure of the different barn swallow *BDNF* isoforms. <br />
Tables contaning all computed values are provided. `Big exons` files contain coding exons coordinates. `Small exons` files contain non coding exons coordinates. `Whole` files contain full length sequences coordinates.  <br />
The file [CpG_islands](https://github.com/SwallowGenomics/BarnSwallow/blob/main/Plots%20and%20figures/BDNF%20gene%20structure-plot/CpG_islands.xlsx) contains CpG islands coordinates within *BDNF* gene.
