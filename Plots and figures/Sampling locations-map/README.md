The R file present in this folder contains the commands used to generate the map reporting the locations of all samples used for the analyses. <br />
The legend can be drawn with the [ComplexHeatmap](https://jokergoo.github.io/ComplexHeatmap-reference/book/) package using this [script](https://github.com/SwallowGenomics/BarnSwallow/blob/main/Plots%20and%20figures/Sampling%20locations-map/legend_script.R).
